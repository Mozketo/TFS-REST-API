# TFS REST API

Micrsoft offer a reasonable API to access TFS programmatically as long as you're OK writing .NET code (C#, VB.NET, etc). TFS REST API offers a nice layer between the TFS API and your preferred language of choice. 

This project is written in C# and Nancy. I'm not creating a comprensive mapping so you're welcome to fork and extend as you see fit.

## How to build

1. Grab the source and run Build.cmd,
2. Or open in Visual Studio, tweak and build,
3. The only catch will be having Visual Studio installed to resolve GAC references to the TFS API dependencies.

## How to Deploy
